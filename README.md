# POS-Tagging-And-NER-Using-RNN-LSTM-GRU-Viterbi-algorithm

In this Project, we want to practice some methods of solving sequential problems on the two problems of **Part of Speech Tagging** and **Named Entity Recognition** and examine the differences and challenges of each of them.

### Dataset

The dataset of this project is from the `Penn Treebank (PTB)` dataset, which is accessible by the `nltk` library.

\* For running the code, in case you want to read the emission matrix for Viterbi algorithm make sure you have “emission_ptb.csv” and “NER_emission_15.csv” files.

## Part 1: Part of Speech Tagging (POS) 

* Importing `Penn Treebank` dataset using `nltk`
* Explanation of **Markov chain** & **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**
* Explanation of **Transition Matrix** & **Emission Probabilities**
* Implementing **Viterbi** algorithm
* POS tagging using Viterbi algorithm
* POS tagging using `RNN`
* POS tagging using `LSTM`
* POS tagging using `GRU`
* Explaining `LSTM` & `GRU` gates
* Discussing `LSTM` vs `GRU`
* Comparing & analyzing results

## Part 2: Named entity Recognition (NER)

* Importing `Penn Treebank` dataset using `nltk`
* Explanation of `IOB tag`
* NER using adjusted `Viterbi algorithm`
